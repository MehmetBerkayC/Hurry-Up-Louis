## <p align="center">What is this?</p>
Hurry Up Louis is a short Adventure game where player controls the actions of a fish named Louis that is late for work.

## <p align="center">*Once an Unfinished Prototype 09.04.2024*</p>
Made for a 7 days Game Jam called "FishFest" in collaboration with [Abdullah Dedeoğlu](https://github.com/abdullahdedeoglu) and [Çağatay Ateş](https://github.com/AgeOfTheHorseMoon)

## <p align="center">*Now a Polished Demo*</p>
Finally had time to polish the faulty game systems and fix the bugs present in the prototype, I still don't think my focus will be on expanding and continuing this demo but nice to see mistakes I've made previously.
It is still not a complete game but it is close to being a fully functional end product.
